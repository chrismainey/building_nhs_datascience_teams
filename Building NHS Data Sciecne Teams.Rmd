# Key thoughts

<br>

### 1. Build allies

### 2. Understand the question

### 3. Be, or employ, a technical leader

### 4. Release your analysts / data scientists / data engineers

### 5. Leadership is a skill - invest in it.

# 1. Build allies

## Internal
+ Senior sponsorship in you organisation.

+ IT / cyber-security colleagues.

+ Project / service leads.

--

## External
+ Your own local economy.

+ Regional or National Groups - NHS-R.

+ Identify teams/project/people that you like and contact them.

+ More room to work together than you might think.

+ Increasing use of Open Licences too!

# Understand the question

.pull-left[
+ For each piece of analysis

+ For your team or organisation's priorities

+ Don't be afraid to work at a question until it's clear

+ Use the question as a tool to build your team: e.g. training

+ Don't be afraid to say 'no'

+ People will go around you if you aren't helpful

+ Get the experience in!

+ Study if you get the opportunity, because you'll learn a lot.

+ You are in a marathon, not a sprint:
 + What tech do you teams currently use?
 + What sort of question do they answer?
 + Do you have any budget?
 + Can you use a question to skill your team up?
 
+ Work out where you want to get to, and how, with a timescale
 
+ Demonstrate return on investment / what-if

+ Ask for forgiveness rather than permission

# 4. Release your analysts / data scientists

+ Recruit good people - you might have to think about how you recruit

+ If you have keen / experienced managers, give them a purpose / direction

+ If you have keen / skilled junior team members

+ Most people don't think they are a data scientist at first

+ Train people, allow them to attend things and grow

+ Allow them the space to try new things

# 5. Leadership is a skill - invest in it.

+ As the leader, it's your job to give everyone in your team a direction

+ It's not for you to solve their problems for them

+ Delegate

+ It's ok for people to do things differently than you would

--

+ Vision is important - 
  + Is a good techie a poor leader?
  + Is a good leader a poor techie?

--

+ I don't know many 'born leaders'.  Most of us learn

+ Find people who you respect to learn from

+ This takes time and you will make mistakes

+ Learn ways to counter for your weaknesses
